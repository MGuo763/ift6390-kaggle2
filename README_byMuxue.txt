I haven't included the CSVs train_data_cleaned.csv, test_data_cleaned.csv, 
    kernel1.csv and the predictions for the 99 examples for SVM,
    as the .gitignore specifies to ignore them and it makes sense

Send me a message if you think I should include them since they will save some
    computation time 
    (especially for kernel1 which isn't big but holy it takes time to compute!)
